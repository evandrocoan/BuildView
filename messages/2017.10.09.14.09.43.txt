Release notes (Mon Oct 9 2017):
- Rework settings to be reads from your `.sublime-settings` file(s), and hence
  respects sublime's settings hierarchy, so you can, for example, enable the
  plugin only for selected projects;
- Reduce significantly time before hiding built-in build results panel; if you
  prefer hiding it completely, you can use "show_panel_on_build" (works in ST3
  but not ST2). Suggested by @Birnbaum2001, documented in README by
  @insilica (@zakpatterson) in pull #15.
